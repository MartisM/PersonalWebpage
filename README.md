Project: Personal Webpage/Portfolio
Title: Martynas Mockapetris Personal Portfolio

Webpage that was built using Jade and Sass preprocessors.
Working environmnet was set using jekyll and gulp.

Jekyll was used as a CMS to control the entire workflow of the project.
Gulp was used to run a local server with a live reload.

Additional information that has to be mentioned is:
Skeleton was used as a workframe for the webpage main layout.
Bourbon was used to even more lighten work with SASS.
Inspiration and Motivation was taken from Travis Devtips.

Entire responsiveness was built from scratch so minor errors accross
devices might occur. Over time I believe I will manage to fix all of them
if not already did that.

Thank you all who have helped me and participated in this project,
without them this would not be in the daylight.
